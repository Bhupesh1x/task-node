# Task Node

## Description
**Task Node** is a **workflow automation platform** built from scratch. It allows users to visually create, automate, and execute complex workflows using a drag-and-drop canvas powered by **React Flow**.  

With support for multiple triggers, AI providers, background job execution, messaging integrations, and full SaaS business features, Task Node delivers everything required to build and run an automation platform similar to Zapier, Make, or n8n.

Users can:
- Build workflows visually using a node-based canvas.
- Choose from multiple triggers (Webhook, Google Form, Stripe events, or manual execution).
- Automate actions using AI models like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.
- Send automated messages through Slack or Discord.
- Run long-running or scheduled tasks using Inngest.
- Manage authentication and subscriptions.
